  It's just a newer version of an old project I delevoped at school as my final paper.
  It  s a simple chat that uses socket.io to make a real time connection and send informaton.
  The original project used handlebars to handle the client page and render the messages
but it was because I was learnign abotu web pages and the course taught it, but it's not actualy necessary.
  I'll add private messages when I have some free time.
